## What is the Dawning?

The Dawning is a reoccurring event every year to celebrate Christmas, just in Destiny fashion.

## My opinions

**The quest to upgrade a ship with shaders and transmat effects unique to the ship by completing quest steps was interesting and engaging**

Explain

**The community quest was passed on by many people I know and it showed - Bungie had to adjust the rate at which we as community progress but the quest just did not feel right for me**

Explain

**The tower looked astoundingly beautiful throughout the event**

Explain

**No special mode or mechanics made the event feel very shallow and seem more like a cash grab**

Every Dawning I get reminded by old school players that they received Sparrow
Racing League in Destiny. Even in the first Dawning in Destiny 2 we got a new
mechanic to use snowballs throughout the world of Destiny; yes, that included
for example strikes. So I was kind of sad when I heard there is will not be
anything new this Dawning yet again. On one side it is nice to not miss out on
too many things because usually everybody is very busy throughout the holiday
days but on the other side Destiny is the game I want to spend my time on and
not having anything new really except for snowball fights in the tower was not
the worst thing in the world but still did not get me hyped for Dawning too
much.

**There were no good places to farm for specific ingredients when baking cookies**

Yes, Dark Ether Cane, I am looking at you.
