## Introduction to incentives

Many youths ago I remember a time when you actually played games for fun: a stunning environment and setting, an out of the ordinary story and interesting character backgrounds, enjoying your time online or on the same couch with people, amazing visuals and sound design or simply engaging gameplay.
These days you more and more get to see additional incentives for players to stay engaged in a game. Most of them are related to a principle called 'Fear of missing out' or short FOMO. The most prominent examples of this principle are events or season passes because they provide specific loot or cosmetical items for a limited amount of time so if you want that stuff you are forced to engage with the game in that timeframe - after that timeframe it is gone for good.
I do not want to condemn FOMO here because there are also interesting possibilities connected to the exclusivity of specific items like for example real plush items or statues as a reward that a business cannot afford to produce for more than a few months.

## Where is Destiny in all of this

I already mentioned incentives as to why a player should play a game, albeit not necessarily good or enjoyable ones. But there can also be interesting and fun incentives for gamers to play and grind a game - and Destiny as a Looter-Shooter requires more of those than many other games or genres out there. Every player is looking for something different in a game and the more of those incentives as a game you fulfill the higher the chances a player will try you.

### The good ones

Here is a quick list of incentives that I believe are positive and I personally value in the Destiny franchise:

- Fun gameplay
  - Facinating visual design
  - Great sound design
  - Power fantasy of the character
- Good progression spacing
- Challenges / Challenging content
- Rewards
  - Ingame loot
  - Exclusive ingame items
  - Exclusive access to shop items
- Achievements / Triumphs
- Sci-Fi-Setting / Lore
- Meeting people / Making friends

### The bad ones

Just for reference sake here is also a list my opinionated list of negative incentives that I would wish to see go in the Destiny franchise:

- Fear of missing out (FOMO)
  - Seasonal loot
  - Seasonal pass
- Sunsetting

CUT THIS? I UNDERSTAND WHY DESTINY NEEDS MOST OF THESE
