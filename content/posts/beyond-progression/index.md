## Incentives or Why should someone play Destiny

Many youths ago I remember a time when you actually played games for fun - and that part should still suffice for everyone and you aswell!
Just a quick reminder: If you do not enjoy playing a game maybe take a step back and question if you really want to play this game right now or if you are just slugging through its content because you need to finish this season pass, collection piece or whatever it is the game is offering maybe aswell just for a limited time. Those are partly shady business tactics to keep you invested in the game and spend time and money on it (but more on that maybe another time). With that life advice out of the way let's get into the actual topic!

I already mentioned incentives as to why a player should play a game, albeit not necessarily good or enjoyable ones. But there can also be interesting and fun incentives for gamers to play and grind a game - and Destiny as a Looter-Shooter requires more of those than many other games or genres out there. Every player is looking for something different in a game and the more of those incentives as a game you fulfill the higher the chances a player will try you.

### The good ones

Here is a quick list of incentives that I believe are positive and I personally value in the Destiny franchise:

- Fun gameplay
- Challenges / Challenging content
- Rewards
  - Ingame loot
  - Exclusive ingame items
  - Exclusive access to shop items
- Achievements / Triumphs
- Sci-Fi-Setting / Lore
- Meeting people / Making friends

### The bad ones

Just for reference sake here is also a list my opinionated list of negative incentives that I would wish to see go in the Destiny franchise:

- Fear of missing out (FOMO)
  - Seasonal loot
  - Seasonal pass
- Sunsetting

CUT THIS? I UNDERSTAND WHY DESTINY NEEDS MOST OF THESE
