What is Iron Banner?

## Gameplay (focus on things specific to Iron Banner not PvP in general)

- Freelance Playlist
- Power enabled -> make sunsetting matter in PvP
- Quest: not returning to Saladin in between steps

* Often people leave unwinnable matches
* Quest: forced to play with specific weapon archetypes/playstyles - also contesting with team mates
* Quest: step after step but partly fulfilling requirements from before?

## Loot

- Interesting weapon perk selections
- Additional pinnacles (if you think of power leveling as content)

* Previously available armor
* Not much new stuff to look forward to -> IB feels very same-y to before
* Unable to farm for specific things
* Matches drop loot that does not belong to Iron Banner
* No new triumphs
