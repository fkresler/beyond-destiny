## What is Iron Banner?

Iron Banner is a limited-time PvP game mode that is available around once per month or three times per season and lasts for a week each time. In that timeframe a special vendor called Saladin is available in the tower who offers bounties and quests and loot directly bound to Iron Banner.

The mode itself is based on the mode Control where the objective is to capture zones and depending on how many zones your team has each kill is scoring your team 1 to 3 points. The team that gets to 150 points first or is leading with a big enough amount of points to trigger an early mercy wins the match.

One thing that is making Iron Banner different from Control is called 'The Hunt'. Basically the hunt begins as soon as one team captures all 3 available zones and lasts for 30 seconds. In that timeframe the 3 zones are locked to that team and cannot be recaptured by anyone. This obviously is the prime time for the team in control of all the zones to go ham and hunt down the other team for as many points as they can. But after that hunt has passed all zones will be reset to a neutral state and need to be recaptured by both teams to get the advantage.

The other thing that separates Iron Banner from Control is that in Iron Banner your power level actually matters (at the time of writing this blog entry it takes into account your base power level without the additional power from the artifact) which in turn is influencing the weapon choices of players because weapons that cannot be upgraded to the highest power levels will net you an inherent disadvantage.

## General

- Timegating

## Gameplay (focus on things specific to Iron Banner not PvP in general)

- Freelance Playlist
- Power enabled -> make sunsetting matter in PvP
- Quest: not returning to Saladin in between steps

- Often people leave unwinnable matches
- Quest: forced to play with specific weapon archetypes/playstyles - also contesting with team mates
- Quest: step after step but partly fulfilling requirements from before?

## Loot

- Interesting weapon perk selections
- Additional pinnacles (if you think of power leveling as content)

- Previously available armor
- Not much new stuff to look forward to -> IB feels very same-y to before
- Unable to farm for specific things
- Matches drop loot that does not belong to Iron Banner
- No new triumphs
