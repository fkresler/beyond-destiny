## What is Iron Banner?

Iron Banner is a limited-time PvP game mode that is available around once per month or three times per season and lasts for a week each time. In that timeframe a special vendor called Saladin is available in the tower who offers bounties and quests and loot directly bound to Iron Banner.

The mode itself is based on the mode Control where the objective is to capture zones and depending on how many zones your team has each kill is scoring your team 1 to 3 points. The team that gets to 150 points first or is leading with a big enough amount of points to trigger an early mercy wins the match.

One thing that is making Iron Banner different from Control is called 'The Hunt'. Basically the hunt begins as soon as one team captures all 3 available zones and lasts for 30 seconds. In that timeframe the 3 zones are locked to that team and cannot be recaptured by anyone. This obviously is the prime time for the team in control of all the zones to go ham and hunt down the other team for as many points as they can. But after that hunt has passed all zones will be reset to a neutral state and need to be recaptured by both teams to get the advantage.

The other thing that separates Iron Banner from Control is that in Iron Banner your power level actually matters (at the time of writing this blog entry it takes into account your base power level without the additional power from the artifact) which in turn is influencing the weapon choices of players because weapons that cannot be upgraded to the highest power levels will net you an inherent disadvantage.

## How do I feel about Iron Banner in Season of the Hunt?

**Additional monthly pinnacle rewards feel like a nice addition to the repetitive power grind, as long as you need them**

Like many players I would wish power leveling would not happen as often as it currently does as well because it gets repetitive every new season. But apparently power leveling is here to stay and part of the content every new season so we have to deal with it in the foreseeable future and Iron Banner provides me with a welcome addition to the weekly repetitions to level my character. So I was actually looking forward to finish all 4 of the pinnacle bounties to get up to 1257 gear level so I can start to take on 1280 challenges as soon as possible. The thing is this incentive worked for me this time but the following months I will probably already be at max gear level and those pinnacle rewards will not do much for me.

**The specialized Iron Banner loot pool contains interesting and desirable rewards**

Let's be real here: there are two types of rewards in that loot pool that provide me with an incentive to play Iron Banner: interesting weapons and perk combinations and a chance on highly statted armor rolls. Additionally there was introduced a new emblem and 2 new shaders. The thing with those rewards is that they are static and just need to be unlocked once and you are done with them. Personally I looked up the possible perk combinations for the new weapons first and noted my desired combinations and rolls too look for, some of which are only available on weapons specifically available in Iron Banner: Iron Grip and Iron Gaze. And I actually like that. Exclusive perks at the very least make me want to take those for a spin itno the Curcible or some PvE activities to give them a shot - along with possibly good perk combinations.

**Playing Iron Banner matches does not feel rewarding, at all**

- Unable to farm for specific things
- Matches drop loot that does not belong to Iron Banner

**It feels demotivating to not be able to grind for individual rewards**

**The freelance playlist for Iron Banner made matches more enjoyable**

**The PvP weapon meta seemed to be very diverse and enjoyable**

**Sunsetting removed previously stable (and too powerful) weapon picks from the PvP weapon meta**

- Power enabled -> make sunsetting matter in PvP

**The Iron Banner questline seemed to be unnecessary (even more so on multiple characters)**

- Quest: not returning to Saladin in between steps
- Quest: forced to play with specific weapon archetypes/playstyles - also contesting with team mates
- Quest: step after step but partly fulfilling requirements from before?

**Iron Banner feels the same-y to before**

- Not much new stuff to look forward to -> IB feels very same-y to before
- No new triumphs
- Few new rewards
