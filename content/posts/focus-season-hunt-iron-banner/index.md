## What is Iron Banner?

Iron Banner is a limited-time PvP game mode that is available around once per month or three times per season and lasts for a week each time. In that timeframe a special vendor called Saladin is available in the tower who offers bounties and quests and loot directly bound to Iron Banner.

The mode itself is based on the mode Control where the objective is to capture zones and depending on how many zones your team has each kill is scoring your team 1 to 3 points. The team that gets to 150 points first or is leading with a big enough amount of points to trigger an early mercy wins the match.

One thing that is making Iron Banner different from Control is called 'The Hunt'. Basically the hunt begins as soon as one team captures all 3 available zones and lasts for 30 seconds. In that timeframe the 3 zones are locked to that team and cannot be recaptured by anyone. This obviously is the prime time for the team in control of all the zones to go ham and hunt down the other team for as many points as they can. But after that hunt has passed all zones will be reset to a neutral state and need to be recaptured by both teams to get the advantage.

The other thing that separates Iron Banner from Control is that in Iron Banner your power level actually matters (at the time of writing this blog entry it takes into account your base power level without the additional power from the artifact) which in turn is influencing the weapon choices of players because weapons that cannot be upgraded to the highest power levels will net you an inherent disadvantage.

## General

**Personally I actually like that Iron Banner is a limited-time PvP event because that allows me to devote quite some time into one single aspect of a game I like.**
Most weekly resets I would just do my 3-5 weekly Crucible games to get my weekly rewards more specifically the pinnacle drop from the director, the bright dust from the weekly bounties and the powerful drop from Shax which happens to be a reskinned armor piece for Crucible this season. Sometimes when I feel competitive and have not much to do I decide to jump into competitive and try to get to higher glory rankings but mostly that does not feel rewarding enough.

Speaking about rewarding. Iron Banner feels a lot more rewarding than normal PvP playlists and at first glance you can see why:

- Iron Banner has a seasonal armor set (albeit mostly reskinned in previous seasons including this season)
- Iron Banner has a lot of weapon drops, some with influence on the weapon meta (albeit only 2 new weapons this season)
- Iron Banner has exclusive weapon perk combinations (specifically featuring Iron Gaze and Iron Grip)
- Additional pinnacle sources

**Because Iron Banner has its own loot pool and some interesting perk combinations and even more so some exclusive to the Iron Banner loot pool there are so many things to chase after!**

- You get guaranteed pinnacle rewards that provide you with a +2 boost to something at your current power level
- You get a good shot at high-statted armor pieces
- You get a shot at interesting perk combinations on weapons
- You get a shot at getting weapons featuring the perks exclusive to the Iron Banner loot pool and being able to experiment with them

**I would like to see those strengths of the playlist even more reinforced!** Provide me with more reasons to stay in Iron Banner and play more games! It is a fine line because when people miss an Iron Banner week they feel left out if you put really good and cool stuff into the playlist and it is limited-time only.

**But there is more to being a rewarding game mode than just some cool and unique loot.** Let's take a step back and take a look at my past week in Iron Banner. I started of by looking up the new weapons and perks I could get on the new Iron Banner weapons and hyped up I noted some of which I would like to give run in the Crucible! Afterwards I went to Saladin and collected my seasonal Iron Banner quest to unlock the seasonal Iron Banner armor pieces and the bounties that provide me with additional pinnacle sources that are interesting to me because I am not at the maximum power cap yet. I pretty much played around 20-25 games in Iron Banner to finish everything previously mentioned and even though I still had my previously noted rolls to grind for and despite my fancy PvP build ideas I could have tried I never went back into Iron Banner. So here is when you might ask: Why?

First of all: **at no point throughout this week I felt like I could achieve getting my desired rolls on Iron Banner weapons**. At all. Not with a houndred hours of play time just playing Iron Banner. You get the chance of a drop specific to the COMPLETE Iron Banner loot pool when finishing one of the 4 weekly bounties, when giving enough tokens to Saladin or after finishing a match. But you have no influence on what you get. And despite just introducing 2 new weapons this season the Iron Banner loot pool is massive with all previous weapons. Now good luck getting a specific weapon out of it and even more so getting a specific perk or perk combination.

Since there is this huge loot pool the best thing you can do is to get as many shots as you can at the reward you desire. Therefore the best thing you can do is to play as many matches as you can to get as many chances as you can. This ties directly into my second sour taste: **finishing Iron Banner matches can drop loot outside of Iron Banner**. Yup. Not only do I have to pray to RNG to get the specific weapon or armor in the Iron Banner loot pool. No, I also have to offer my firstborn as a sacrifice to even get a drop from the Iron Banner loot pool. This makes it extremely RNG reliant to grind for something you desire and puts your goals to something near impossible to reach. Which is something I do not like and probably many other people do not like as well.

## Gameplay (focus on things specific to Iron Banner not PvP in general)

- Freelance Playlist
- Power enabled -> make sunsetting matter in PvP
- Quest: not returning to Saladin in between steps

- Often people leave unwinnable matches
- Quest: forced to play with specific weapon archetypes/playstyles - also contesting with team mates
- Quest: step after step but partly fulfilling requirements from before?

## Loot

- Interesting weapon perk selections
- Additional pinnacles (if you think of power leveling as content)

- Previously available armor
- Not much new stuff to look forward to -> IB feels very same-y to before
- Unable to farm for specific things
- Matches drop loot that does not belong to Iron Banner
- No new triumphs
