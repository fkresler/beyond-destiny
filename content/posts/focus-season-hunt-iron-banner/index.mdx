## What is Iron Banner?

Iron Banner is a limited-time PvP game mode that is available around once per month or three times per season and lasts for a week each time. In that timeframe a special vendor called Saladin is available in the tower who offers bounties and quests and loot directly bound to Iron Banner.

The mode itself is based on the mode Control where the objective is to capture zones and depending on how many zones your team has each kill is scoring your team 1 to 3 points. The team that gets to 150 points first or is leading with a big enough amount of points to trigger an early mercy wins the match.

One thing that is making Iron Banner different from Control is called 'The Hunt'. Basically the hunt begins as soon as one team captures all 3 available zones and lasts for 30 seconds. In that timeframe the 3 zones are locked to that team and cannot be recaptured by anyone. This obviously is the prime time for the team in control of all the zones to go ham and hunt down the other team for as many points as they can. But after that hunt has passed all zones will be reset to a neutral state and need to be recaptured by both teams to get the advantage.

The other thing that separates Iron Banner from Control is that in Iron Banner your power level actually matters (at the time of writing this blog entry it takes into account your base power level without the additional power from the artifact) which in turn is influencing the weapon choices of players because weapons that cannot be upgraded to the highest power levels will net you an inherent disadvantage.

## My opinions

**Additional monthly pinnacle rewards feel like a nice addition to the repetitive power grind (as long as you need them)**

Like many players I would wish power leveling would not happen as often as it currently does as well because it gets repetitive every new season. But apparently power leveling is here to stay and part of the content every new season so we have to deal with it in the foreseeable future and Iron Banner provides me with a welcome addition to the weekly repetitions to level my character. So I was actually looking forward to finish all 4 of the pinnacle bounties to get up to 1257 gear level so I can start to take on 1280 challenges as soon as possible. The thing is this incentive worked for me this time but the following months I will probably already be at max gear level and those pinnacle rewards will not do much for me.

**The specialized Iron Banner loot pool contains interesting and desirable rewards**

Let's be real here: there are two types of rewards in that loot pool that provide me with an incentive to play Iron Banner: interesting weapons and perk combinations and a chance on highly statted armor rolls. Additionally there was introduced a new emblem and 2 new shaders. The thing with those rewards is that they are static and just need to be unlocked once and you are done with them. Personally I looked up the possible perk combinations for the new weapons first and noted my desired combinations and rolls too look for, some of which are only available on weapons specifically available in Iron Banner: Iron Grip and Iron Gaze. And I actually like that. Exclusive perks at the very least make me want to take those for a spin into the Crucible or some PvE activities to give them a shot - along with possibly good perk combinations.

**Playing Iron Banner matches does not feel rewarding, at all**

I have played this Iron Banner for around 20-25 matches to finish the quest alongside the bounties from Saladin. And even though I have not gotten the things I was looking for in my rolls and neither any good statted armor I have not been playing Iron Banner since finishing that last bounty. Now I enjoy playing PvP actually and spinning up build ideas for a bunch of games and I had my fair share of fun in those Iron Banner matches. But the rewards for those matches felt miserable.
The thing that gets me to play the game after I had my fair share of fun is very often a mixture of intrinsic desire to get or do something and at the same time an external incentive in form of rewards. But getting blue rarity items that do not belong into the Iron Banner loot pool does not keep me engaged. And this also ties into my next point.

**It feels demotivating to not be able to grind for individual rewards**

At the very least there are 4 weapons and 5 different armor pieces in the Iron Banner loot pool. And among those weapons there are quite some rolls I would like to take for a spin. But because there are so few reliable ways (also see previous point) to farm for Iron Banner gear and no way to farm for something specific at all it is kind of unrealistic to expect to ever see your personal god roll drop for you. And when I know something is close to impossible to get then why should I spent my time trying so. It is very unlikely to get the specific weapon or armor piece to drop anyways, now what are the chances to get the specific roll to drop then but instead I get a slap in the face with a blue rarity item every now and then.

**The freelance playlist for Iron Banner improved match quality for solo players**

In previous Iron Banners facing 6-stacks mostly made for devastating match outcomes when the queue into the match took longer than the match itself. This Iron Banner I played a fair share of games in the freelance playlist and games have been so much more enjoyable. Every team was playing on an even playing field and had the same chances to win. At the same time it felt like good individual players could have more impact in a game because they would not face worse odds when playing against highly coordinated teams and face worse engages from the start.

**The PvP weapon meta seemed to be very diverse and enjoyable**

I cannot provide overall stats at this point but throughout my matches in the past Iron Banner I believe I have seen every weapon type in at least one match (except for rocket launchers). At the same time I tried various weapons by myself as well and every weapon type felt viable when play right to me. And in my personal opinion that allowed me to switch up my loadouts while not providing me with an inherent disadvantage.

**Sunsetting removed previously stable (and too powerful) weapon picks from the PvP weapon meta**

Sunsetting entirely deserves its own post because it is a very wide subject with many upsides and downsides. The thing is sunsetting takes effect in Iron Banner because in Iron Banner power level actually matters to an extend. Previous meta stables like Recluse and Mountaintop are capped at 1060 power level while players can get up to 1260 in Iron Banner so using them puts you at an immediate disadvantage. And even if I do not see them that often anymore sunsetting reinforces players to shy away from the weapons or at the very least reduces their impact. And albeit there are many disadvantages like previously mentioned there was another interesting thing to consider: sunsetting made me think about which new weapons or loadouts I can choose to bring into Iron Banner instead of previously stable loadouts. It was definitely fun playing around with Deafening Whisper and Glacier Grenade but I can understand the disappointment of players to be forced away from their favorite weapons.

**The Iron Banner questline seemed to be unnecessary (even more so on multiple characters)**

- Quest: not returning to Saladin in between steps
- Quest: forced to play with specific weapon archetypes/playstyles - also contesting with team mates
- Quest: step after step but partly fulfilling requirements from before?

**Iron Banner feels the same-y to before**

- Not much new stuff to look forward to -> IB feels very same-y to before
- No new triumphs
- Few new rewards
