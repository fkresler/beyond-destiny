## Hi there!

Welcome to my personal space where I am living, breathing and thinking about Destiny 2!

## Who am I?

I have been playing Destiny 2 now since its release on PC. Sometimes more, sometimes less (_cough_
Year 1 - Curse of Osiris _cough_). Like most people I also had multiple ups and downs throughout its lifetime and
at the very least have tried most if not all of the activities available (including emote dance parties in the tower
or the farm or snowball fights during the Dawning). Albeit I am part of a very hardcore Destiny clan I enjoy
playing the game at my own pace.

## Why Beyond Destiny?

My guess is all of you who are reading this are familiar with the Destiny franchise or at the very least the game.
Most guardians are fine simply playing the game but some just like to not just go beyond light but want to take it even
further. Some players do not just like to play the game as it is but like to imagine what this game could be like at
its best. And since you are here you are probably one of those. You enjoy playing the game but you want to think
further, you want to imagine further. And here I welcome you taking part in my thoughts, my ideas about Destiny.

## What topics can you expect?

There are 3 types of different contents planned for this blog:

- **Focus**: This is where I will pick one specific activity or aspect of the game, explain how and why I think of it as
  I do and then follow it up with some ideas on how it could be improved upon.
- **Recap**: This is where I will recapitulate the previous season or expansion/year altogether and analyze it in the big
  picture: how did it fit into the timeline of Destiny, what went good, what did not go as well as it should have and why,
  how could the season have looked like in a different timeline and so on.
- **Weapon**: This is where I will take one specific weapon and talk about its stats, what perks and perk combinations
  you should look forward to and how you can make this weapon work.

I hope you enjoy diving into my thoughts or what I could personally imagine Destiny to be as much as I enjoy writing down
my opinions and ideas. Also if you agree, like or even disagree with me feel free to contact me openly, I appreciate
your fellow Guardian thoughts, suggestions and opinions highly!

Eyes up guardian!
