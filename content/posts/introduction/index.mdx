## Hi there!

Welcome to my personal space where I am living, breathing and thinking about Destiny 2!

## Who am I?

I have been playing Destiny 2 now since its release on PC. Sometimes more, sometimes less (_cough_
Year 1 - Curse of Osiris _cough_). Like most people I also had multiple ups and downs throughout its lifetime and
at the very least have tried most if not all of the activities available (including emote dance parties in the tower
or the farm or snowball fights during the Dawning). Albeit I am part of a very hardcore Destiny clan I enjoy
playing the game at my own pace.

## Why Beyond Destiny?

My guess is all of you who are reading this are familiar with the Destiny franchise or at the very least the game.
Most guardians are fine simply playing the game but some just like to not just go beyond light but want to take it even
further. Some players do not just like to play the game as it is but like to imagine what this game could be like at
its best. And since you are here you are probably one of those. You enjoy playing the game but you want to think
further, you want to imagine further. And here I welcome you taking part in my thoughts, my ideas about Destiny.

I hope you enjoy diving into my thoughts or what I could personally imagine Destiny to be as much as I enjoy writing down
my opinions and ideas. Also if you agree, like or even disagree with me feel free to contact me openly, I appreciate
your fellow Guardian thoughts, suggestions and opinions highly!

Eyes up guardian!
