Hi there!

Welcome to my blog about my thoughts on Destiny 2! I hope you enjoy reading some of the posts and if you like some of it or have some additional thoughts or ideas on your own feel free to share it with me on Twitter or e-mail.

Something short about myself first: I have been playing Destiny 2 now since its release on PC. Sometimes more, sometimes less (_cough_ Year 1 - Curse of Osiris _cough_). Like most people I also had multiple ups and downs throughout its lifetime and at the very least have tried most if not all of the activities available (including emote dance parties in the tower or the farm). Albeit I am part of a very hardcore Destiny clan I enjoy playing the game at my own pace.

And while there are so many things about this game that I like, I also mentioned that I had downs throughout the last few years. And sometimes in those daring times (and also in the mostly good times) you begin to wonder how much more Destiny 2 could be and how Bungie could make practically no-life Destiny 2. So this is where we are right now! Right in this blog I am collecting my thoughts and ideas about Destiny 2 and what in my personal opinion could have been! I hope you enjoy reading through some of it as much as I had fun thinking and creating ideas around my probably most favorite game of all time.

Eyes up guardian!
