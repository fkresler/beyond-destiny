So Season of the Hunt, the first season established with Beyond Light. A minor warning for spoilers: **There will be spoilers, so if you want to experience the Story and everything on your own, be careful while reading**. If you want to voice your own opinion about Season of the Hunt feel free to send your feedback towards Bungie and their much appreciated community managers as they are asking for it:

## Lore

In my opinion many people do not realize that the season did not kick off with the quest one week after Beyond Light dropped. For me the season started the same day I got into Zavala's office and got to pick up the Fang of Xivu Arath. The moment I picked that up I got to listen to Osiris and what he has been up to after Mercury got sucked into Darkness. After that you could listen to radio messages every day and often it was Osiris foreshadowing our future seasonal content that lead to that first quest that introduced most of the players to the season.

**I loved that the seasonal content was teased by something like simple radio messages** (you can still listen to those messages and probably get even more hints towards future content, no spoileroni). Also it intertwined the lore of Season of the Hunt with the normal Beyond Light story somewhat and made it fit into a bigger picture.

Next thing that happened this Season was the introductional quest. It was kind of a simple quest that progressed the lore while at the same time introducing us to the seasonal content. That quest actually did so much for the story:

- Sagira has died for real: I would have personally wished to experience a cutscene because Sagira was such a funny and charismatic character I liked during the Curse of Osiris campaign back in Year 1 and her minor appearances throughout the Destiny 2 lifespan.
- Uldren alias The Crow is working for spider: the introduction of the Crow was perfect for me, good job there Bungie! From an anonymous ghost who was giving us instructions or offering help by radio at the beginning of the hunt to the big blowout of revealing Uldren as Guardian and his role as a pet for The Spider. Amazing introduction.
- The Spider's character went from kind neighborhood traider to someone you should be careful of: this guy will blow up Pulled Pork or Glint the moment The Crow gets too far away from the Tangled Shore. This evolved Spider personally for me from a cool albeit shady vendor that I do some cleanup work for to one of those dirty mafia bosses. Also this provides so much potential for future lore and story development.

**The best part about that quest for me personally was that I could play through the story, I could see it develop, I could see the characters feel their roles, I could experience stuff happening in the game!** This did so much good: it connected the story, it made me experience things in the Destiny universe I otherwise would just read on external sites, it developed characters or even re-developed them. And it seems there is more to come as The Crow just today was wondering where the Cabal actually are that got sucked into the Cryptolith. Keep it going Bungie!

**Overall the story arc of Season of the Hunt and its activity do not feel like a completely separate thing that needed to be added because it is another season but another started sidequest of our guardian that we have to figure out how it fits into the greater scheme of things, it simply feels embeded into the world of Destiny and its living world and progressing story.**
