## Beyond Light

Beyond Light started off the next year in the Destiny franchise. It was supposed to be the next big content drop that keeps its player base interested and happy with the game. So to start this big picture of let us take a look at what Beyond Light at the very least introduced:

- 1 completely new destination in Europa featuring:
  - New armor and weapons
  - Glassway as a new strike
  - Secrets, Triumphs and a new title
  - Empire Hunts as a new activity featuring Cloudstrike as loot
  - Exo Challenges as a new activity
  - Deep Stone Crypt as a new raid with new armor and weapons featuring Eyes of Tomorrow as loot
- A new story arc featuring new story missions and a narrative entangled into the world of Destiny
- A new subclass system featuring the stasis subclass for each class
- 1 previously in Destiny 1 available destination in the Cosmodrome featuring 1 strike
- A new New Light experience in the Cosmodrome as introduction for new players
- 3 reskinned armor sets and 3 new weapons, bound to one for each core playlists
- Legendary lost sectors as a new activity featuring 6 new exotic armor pieces as loot
- New exotic quests for No Time to Explain, Salvation's Grip, The Lament

So content-wise Beyond Light actually featured quite a lot of new things to do and chase and personally I have been happy with the content for quite a while. But Destiny is not just new content. The way Destiny is played or supposed to be played is reliant on Destiny's core like what kind of loot is available in the game, how can loot be acquired or how can players make use of their loot. Those are fundamental questions for a game and depending on how they are answered the genre of a game could be defined completely different.

## Destiny's core

With Beyond Light Bungie pushed new and actually very impactful changes to the core of Destiny's loot and content system that kind of push Destiny into another genre as a game:

- **DCV (Destiny Content Vault)**: The Destiny Content Vault is a system designed by Bungie to cycle content like destinations or activities in and out of the game, depending on what Bungie sees fit. The original reasoning by Bungie to introduce the DCV was that they cannot keep growing Destiny 2 and its increasing disk size infinitely or rather until Bungie does decide to not continue with Destiny 2. The latest example of the DCV taking action was removing content that was available in Destiny since its beginnings with the Red War campaign: destinations like Titan, Io, Mercury and Mars featuring all their included story missions or missions in general, content like lost sectors, dungeons or activities like Escalation Protocol. **To conclude the DCV directly impacts the activities and things to do in the game by rotating content like destinations and activities into and out of the DCV.**
- **Sunsetting**:

I completely understand Bungie's reasoning for introducing the DCV and sunsetting and I still believe if done right it can create an amazing environment for Destiny as a franchise to grow and expand and introduce crazy new things. Overall there were many opportunities but also many valid concerns. And I would like to take a look at my first feelings regarding those changes, what went well and what could be improved in my opinion.
